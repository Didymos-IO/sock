# TODO

- [ ] Twitch.JS chat integration. Read chat, post in chat, and verbally respond to chat.
- [ ] TTS Mode: Puppet speaks from Chat or from user Type, instead of brain chip. (Toggle between that and AI brain, affects other settings.)
- [ ] Extend personality editor to include more traits and more options for each trait.
- [ ] Investigate using `gpt4all` to provide alternative for chat completion.
  - https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_python.html
  - https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all- [ ] When pause is detected in speech, fire off transcription.
- [ ] Chattiness: Have a pause duration trigger that can be configured to trigger a response.
- [ ] Research [`use-whisper`](https://github.com/chengsokdara/use-whisper) &/| [`whisper-faster`](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) to speed up transcription
- [ ] Safety/Emergency Disconnect (mute + stop listening)
